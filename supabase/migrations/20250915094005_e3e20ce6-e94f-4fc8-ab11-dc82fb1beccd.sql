-- Fix security issues: Add RLS policies for analytics views access

-- Enable RLS on views (admin access only for analytics)
-- Note: Views inherit RLS from underlying tables, but we'll add explicit admin checks

-- Create RLS policies for analytics access
-- First, ensure all referenced tables have proper RLS

-- Fix any missing RLS on core tables
ALTER TABLE workout_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE set_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; 
ALTER TABLE exercise_notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE userprogress ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE programday ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
