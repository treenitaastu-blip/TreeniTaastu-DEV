# Analytics System Audit and Fixes Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå **Admin Analytics Missing Data** - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Admin analytics page was missing total users, new users, and other key metrics.
**Root Cause**: `get_analytics_summary()` function was incomplete.
**Fix**: 
- Updated the RPC function to return all required metrics including:
  - `total_users`, `new_users_7d`, `workouts_started_7d`, `workouts_completed_7d`
  - `avg_sessions_per_user_7d`, `retention_day_7`, `retention_day_30`
- Updated `useAnalytics` hook to properly map all new fields

### 2. ‚ùå **User Streaks Not Working** - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `user_streaks` table was empty, causing incorrect streak displays on homepage.
**Root Cause**: No automatic streak calculation system existed.
**Fix**:
- Created `calculate_user_streaks()` function that properly calculates streaks from both:
  - `userprogress` table (Kontorikeha static program)
  - `workout_sessions` table (Personal training sessions)
- Added triggers to automatically update streaks when progress is made
- Initialized streaks for all existing users

### 3. ‚ùå **Inconsistent Progress Tracking** - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Homepage was using client-side streak calculation while database had proper system.
**Root Cause**: Multiple sources of truth for streak data.
**Fix**:
- `useProgressTracking` hook was already correctly using database `user_streaks` table
- Ensured all components use the database as single source of truth

### 4. ‚ùå **Volume Calculation Verification** - VERIFIED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Needed verification that weight totals were calculated correctly.
**Status**: 
- Verified that `v_session_summary` view correctly calculates volume as `weight_kg_done * reps_done`
- Current data shows 2136kg total volume for active user, which is reasonable

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Correctly**
1. **Admin Analytics**: All metrics now display correctly
   - Total Users: 9
   - Active Users (7d): 2  
   - New Users (7d): 4
   - Completion Rate: 100%
   - Average RPE: 5.74
   - Total Volume: 2136 kg

2. **User Streaks**: Properly calculated and stored
   - User 1: Current streak 3, Best streak 3
   - User 2: Current streak 0, Best streak 3 (last activity 2025-09-26)

3. **Personal Training Stats**: Correctly showing session data, volume, and progress

4. **Homepage Progress**: Now uses correct database streak data

### üìä **Data Verification**
- **Analytics RPC**: Returns complete dataset with 14 metrics
- **Streaks**: Auto-calculated from both static program and PT sessions  
- **Volume**: Correctly calculated as sum of (weight √ó reps) per set
- **Sessions**: Properly tracked with completion status

### üîÑ **Automatic Updates**
- Streaks update automatically when users complete workouts
- Analytics refresh in real-time
- Progress tracking uses live database subscriptions

## Security Notes
- Pre-existing security warnings remain (not related to this audit)
- All new functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper `search_path` 
- RLS policies are respected throughout the system

## Conclusion
All analytics issues have been resolved. The system now provides accurate, real-time statistics across:
- Admin analytics dashboard
- Homepage progress displays  
- Personal training statistics
- User streak tracking

The database is now the single source of truth for all metrics, ensuring consistency across all pages and components.
